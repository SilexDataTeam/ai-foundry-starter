## Key Features

- **LangChain/LangGraph** for flexible AI agent development  
- Support for **agentic capabilities** including tool calling, database interactions, and API integrations  
- **Streaming chat interface** for real-time AI responses  
- **Document ingestion pipeline** using PGVector for vector embeddings  
- Multiple **RAG patterns** implemented (basic, advanced, agentic approaches)

### Frontend
- **Next.js** web application with real-time chat interface  
- **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** for streaming AI responses  
- Responsive design using **Tailwind CSS**  
- **Thumbs up/down** feedback system for AI responses

### Backend
- **FastAPI** service with async support  
- **Keycloak** integration for authentication and authorization  
- **Chat history** persistence in PostgreSQL  
- **OpenTelemetry** integration via Traceloop for observability  
- Comprehensive **unit test coverage**

### Infrastructure
- **Kong API Gateway** for:
  - Multi-model LLM support  
  - Request/response logging  
  - API governance  
  - Rate limiting  
- **PostgreSQL** for:
  - Chat history storage  
  - Vector embeddings (pgvector)  
- **Tekton Pipelines** for automated document ingestion  
- **Helm charts** for easy deployment on Kubernetes/OpenShift  
- Automated telemetry setup with **OpenTelemetry** collector and **Jaeger**

## Architecture

The system consists of several key components:

1. **Chat Frontend (chat-app/)**  
2. **Backend API (backend/)**  
3. **Kong AI Gateway (model-gateway/)**  
4. **PostgreSQL Database + PGVector**  
5. **Keycloak Authentication**  
6. **OpenTelemetry Collector**  
7. **Document Ingestion Pipeline**
